A python program to analyse sentiments from public tweets. The program analyses the sentiments with a polarity threshold of negative values and positive values for negative and positive sentiment respectively. Once it has analysed the sentiments, it writes the data to a csv file with the tweets and their respective sentiments.

You'll need to create a new app on apps.twitter.com to get the access token and consumer key.

The program uses the following packages:

    textblob to analyse the polarity of tweet
    tweepy to use the twitter API
    csv for writing to csv
